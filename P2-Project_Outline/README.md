### Overview
"Mode of Travel Comparison site" My application will provide consumers a bigger picture for making economical decisions on ways of travelling. I came up with this idea probably 10yrs ago, as I moved around a lot and travelled a lot; maybe last minute flight prices were out of my range, but an overnight train ride was feasible. I remember thinking to myself, "I wish I would see all this in one place! I can compare those general costs associated with each, amount of time it takes, and see if there's a sweet spot." I figure other people who are avid travellers or not even but would become more likely to travel if they felt like the research is a little less daunting or that there were actually affordable alternatives, would appreciate this.

It will currently only work domestically (as it assumes American based pricing). However it could function regionally, with a GPS feature if launched globally. Let's say I'm in St. Louis, but want to travel to Memphis, sure I could fly or drive, however what if there was currently a great rate on the Amtrak and I could arrive in the same amount of time, more leg room and not the responsibility to stay awake!? Or if theres a new direct bus route (Greyhound has newer buses with outlets and wifi ability and its been probably 8yrs since I've riden) there and I was able to find that information in one space instead of going to all those different sites, or not even thinking of it at all(because people only ride trains in commuter cities and buses in movies). While maybe not a lot of travelling is happening now, there's a surge in the interest of travel generally and while Americans aren't allowed in other countries, there'll be a new interest in discovering the gems of our own country. This is a great time to provide a resource to people who arent scared to go with a mask on!
